Dan Lowe: IBEIS: an image analysis tool to detect animals in images. It'll be dope yo.My idea is to automate water wheels and remotely control the flow direction of estuaries

Erik Gunderson: TTRPG Toolkit- A toolkit designed for general tabletop roleplaying game usage, allowing GMs to custom define formulas and rulesets while also storing quick and easy character information and stat blocks. Will initially be developed for use with a custom made TTRPG made by a friend, and then extended to more popular systems.
